You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.
*Your task:* create a complete updated code for the attached python app with the following enhancements:
1)  add ability to browse for an input file or files to convert and extract
2)  user can select/upload more than one file before the extraction via the button
3)  a text preview box at the bottom to print the converted text with a copy button like typical AI chat response.
4) make the app as attractive, user-friendly and intuitive like a typical iOS app.
```
Okay, let me start by understanding the user's requirements. They want to enhance the existing Python app with a Gradio interface. The key enhancements are:

Allow browsing and selecting multiple files.
A text preview with a copy button.
A more attractive, iOS-like UI.
First, the original code uses a textbox for the file path. To allow file selection, I need to replace that with a file upload component. Gradio's File component can handle multiple files if the file_count is set to "multiple". But wait, the existing code processes one file at a time. So I need to adjust the processing function to handle a list of files.

Next, the output. The current code saves to a file and returns a message. The user wants a preview box with a copy button. Gradio has a Textbox for output, but to make it look like a chat response with a copy button, maybe use gr.HighlightedText or a combination of Textbox and Button. Alternatively, use gr.Chatbot but that might not fit. Alternatively, a Textbox with a copy button next to it. But how to implement the copy button? Gradio doesn't have a built-in copy button, but maybe use JavaScript with gr.Button that triggers a copy action.

For the UI aesthetics, making it look like an iOS app. Gradio's default theme is simple, but maybe use a custom theme. However, Gradio's theming is limited. Alternatively, use the gr.Blocks to structure the layout with columns, spacing, and styling. Maybe add a header with a title, use a clean layout with the file upload on top, a processing button, and the output below. Use a light theme with rounded corners and proper padding.

Let me check the existing code. The process_file function takes a filename, validates, extracts text, saves, and returns a message. To handle multiple files, the function should loop through each file, process them, and collect results. The output should display the extracted text for each file, perhaps with filenames as headers.

Wait, the user wants a text preview box. So instead of saving to a file, display the text in the UI. But the original code saves the text to a new file. The user might still want to save, but the preview is for immediate feedback. So maybe modify the processing to return the extracted text instead of a message, then display it in the textbox. Also, include a save button or automatically save but show the text.

But the user's point 3 says a text preview with a copy button. So the main output is the text preview, and maybe a separate save button. Or after extraction, show the text and have a button to save.

Let me outline the steps:

Replace the filename textbox with a file upload component that allows multiple files.
Modify the processing function to handle a list of files, extract text from each, and return the combined text or individual texts.
Display the extracted text in a textbox with a copy button.
Style the UI to be more attractive.
For the file upload, in Gradio, the File component can be used with file_count="multiple". The uploaded files are passed as a list of temporary file paths. The existing extract_text function can process each file in the list.

The output needs to display the text. If multiple files are processed, maybe concatenate their texts with separators indicating the filename. Alternatively, use a tabbed interface, but that might complicate. For simplicity, concatenate all texts with headers.

The copy button: Gradio doesn't have a built-in copy button, but we can use a Button that triggers JavaScript to copy the text from the textbox. The js parameter in the button can execute a function that gets the text from the textbox and copies it to the clipboard.

Styling: Use gr.Blocks to structure the layout. Add a header with a title, center-align components, use appropriate spacing. Maybe add a logo or icon, but the user didn't mention that. Use a light theme with rounded corners. Gradio's theme parameter can be set to a modern theme like gr.themes.Default() with some customizations.

Testing the code: Need to ensure that the file upload works, processes multiple files, displays the text correctly, and the copy button functions.

Potential issues: Handling large files might slow down the UI. But the user didn't mention performance, so proceed as is.

Now, modifying the code:

Replace filename_input = gr.Textbox(...) with file_upload = gr.File(label="Upload Files", file_count="multiple").
The process_file function will receive a list of files. Each file in the list is a dictionary with 'name' (temp path), 'orig_name', etc. So loop through each file, process, collect the text.
Modify process_file to take a list of file objects, extract each, and return the combined text.
The output text box should be read-only, maybe with a larger area. Add a button next to it with copy functionality.
Use JavaScript in the button to copy the text. For example, js="navigator.clipboard.writeText(document.getElementById('output_text').value)".
Wait, Gradio's components have elem_id to set the HTML id. So set the output textbox's elem_id to "output_text", then the button's js can reference that.

Putting it all together:

In the UI:

File upload component with multiple selection.
Process button.
Output textbox with elem_id and copy button.
Styling with Blocks layout.
Testing the code step by step. Also, ensure that the extract_text function can handle the temp file paths provided by Gradio's File component.

Another consideration: The original code's save_extracted_text saves to a new file. The user might still want that, but the main output is the preview. So after extraction, display the text and save the files as before. The result message can include both the saved paths and the preview.

But the user's point 3 says "text preview box at the bottom to print the converted text with a copy button". So maybe the save is still done, but the preview is shown. The output message can be the saved file paths, and the textbox shows the text. But combining both might complicate. Alternatively, the processing function returns the extracted text and the save message, then display both.

Alternatively, process each file, save it, and collect all the texts and messages. Then display the texts in the preview and the messages as a log.

But the user probably wants the preview to show the extracted text, not the save messages. So adjust the processing function to return the extracted text instead of the save message. Then, the save is done, but the main output is the text.

Wait, the original process_file function returns a message like "Text successfully saved to ...". But the user wants the text preview. So modify the processing to return the extracted text. However, the original code's save_extracted_text saves the text to a file and returns a message. So perhaps, after extraction, save the text and also return it for display.

So in the processing function:

For each file:

Validate.
Extract text.
Save to file.
Collect the text and the save message.
Then, the output would be the combined text for preview and the messages as a log.

But the user wants the text preview. So maybe the processing function returns the extracted text (for display) and the save messages (as a log). But Gradio's output can only return one value per output component. So perhaps have two output components: one for the text preview and one for the status messages.

Alternatively, combine the status messages and the text into a single output. But that's messy.

Alternatively, the main output is the text preview, and the status messages are shown in a separate textbox or as alerts.

But the user's main focus is the text preview with a copy button. So perhaps the processing function returns the extracted text, and the save is done silently. The user can see the text and copy it, while the files are saved automatically.

But the original code's save_extracted_text function returns a message. So modifying the code to return the text instead.

Wait, the original process_file function does:

def process_file(filename): ... save_result = save_extracted_text(filename, extracted_text) return save_result

Which returns a message like "Text successfully saved to ...".

But the user wants to display the extracted text. So the processing function should return the extracted text. But how to handle multiple files?

Perhaps, for each file, extract the text, save it, and collect all the texts into a single string with separators. Then display that in the textbox.

So modifying the code:

In process_file, which now takes a list of files:

def process_files(files): all_texts = [] for file in files: # Process each file filename = file.name # Assuming Gradio's File component provides the temp path is_valid, error_message = validate_file(filename) if not is_valid: all_texts.append(f"Error processing {file.orig_name}: {error_message}") continue extracted_text, extraction_error = extract_text(filename) if extraction_error: all_texts.append(f"Error extracting from {file.orig_name}: {extraction_error}") continue save_result = save_extracted_text(filename, extracted_text) all_texts.append(f"--- {file.orig_name} ---\n{extracted_text}\n\n{save_result}") return "\n".join(all_texts)

Then, the output textbox displays this combined text.

But need to handle multiple files. Also, the original code's save_extracted_text uses the original filename (without the path) to create the output file. But when using Gradio's File component, the filename is a temp path, and file.orig_name is the original name. So when saving, the output filename should be based on file.orig_name.

Modify save_extracted_text to take the original filename:

def save_extracted_text(original_filename, text): output_filename = os.path.splitext(original_filename)[0] + "_extracted.txt" try: with open(output_filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f: f.write(text) return f"Text successfully saved to {output_filename}" except Exception as e: return f"Error saving file: {str(e)}"

But the original_filename is just the name, not the full path. So saving in the current directory. The user might want to specify a directory, but the original code doesn't handle that. Assuming it's okay.

Putting this together, the process_files function would loop through each uploaded file, process them, collect the texts and messages, and return the combined text.

Now, the UI changes:

Replace the filename input with a File component.
Add a Textbox for output with a larger size.
Add a Button with JavaScript to copy the text.
In Gradio:

def create_ui(): with gr.Blocks() as demo: gr.Markdown("# File Text Extractor") gr.Markdown("Upload files to extract their text content.")

file_upload = gr.File(label="Upload Files", file_count="multiple") output_text = gr.Textbox(label="Extracted Text Preview", lines=20, interactive=False, elem_id="output_text") copy_button = gr.Button("Copy Text") submit_button = gr.Button("Extract Text") submit_button.click( fn=process_files, inputs=file_upload, outputs=output_text ) copy_button.click( fn=None, inputs=None, outputs=None, _js="() => { navigator.clipboard.writeText(document.getElementById('output_text').value); }" ) return demo
Wait, the process_files function needs to be defined to handle the list of files. Also, the original process_file function was for a single file. Need to rename and adjust.

So, in the code, replace the original process_file with a new process_files function that takes a list of file objects.

But in Gradio, when using file_count="multiple", the input to the function is a list of file objects, each with 'name' (temp path), 'orig_name', etc.

So the new process_files function:

def process_files(files): all_results = [] for file in files: temp_filename = file.name original_filename = file.orig_name # Validate is_valid, error_msg = validate_file(temp_filename) if not is_valid: all_results.append(f"Error processing {original_filename}: {error_msg}") continue # Extract text extracted_text, extraction_error = extract_text(temp_filename) if extraction_error: all_results.append(f"Error extracting from {original_filename}: {extraction_error}") continue # Save save_result = save_extracted_text(original_filename, extracted_text) # Combine result all_results.append(f"--- {original_filename} ---\n{extracted_text}\n\n{save_result}") return "\n".join(all_results)

Also, update save_extracted_text to use the original filename:

def save_extracted_text(original_filename, text): # Use the original filename's basename to create the output filename base_name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(original_filename))[0] output_filename = f"{base_name}_extracted.txt" try: with open(output_filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f: f.write(text) return f"Text successfully saved to {output_filename}" except Exception as e: return f"Error saving file: {str(e)}"

This way, the output files are saved in the current directory with the original name plus "_extracted.txt".

Testing this, when a user uploads a file named "example.pdf", the extracted text is saved as "example_extracted.txt".

Now, the UI has a file upload component, a submit button, a textbox for preview, and a copy button. The copy button uses JavaScript to copy the text from the textbox with id "output_text".

Styling: To make it look more attractive, use Gradio's Blocks to arrange components in a clean layout. Maybe add some padding, center-align the components, use a light theme.

For example:

def create_ui(): with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default()) as demo: with gr.Row(): gr.Markdown("# File Text Extractor", elem_classes="header") with gr.Row(): file_upload = gr.File(label="Upload Files", file_count="multiple", elem_classes="file-uploader") with gr.Row(): submit_button = gr.Button("Extract Text", elem_classes="submit-btn") with gr.Row(): output_text = gr.Textbox(label="Extracted Text Preview", lines=15, interactive=False, elem_id="output_text", elem_classes="output-box") with gr.Row(): copy_button = gr.Button("Copy Text", elem_classes="copy-btn")

submit_button.click( fn=process_files, inputs=file_upload, outputs=output_text ) copy_button.click( fn=None, inputs=None, outputs=None, _js="() => { navigator.clipboard.writeText(document.getElementById('output_text').value); }" ) return demo
Then, add custom CSS via the css parameter in gr.Blocks to style the components. For example:

css = """ .header { text-align: center; padding: 20px; background-color: #f0f0f0; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; } .file-uploader { margin: 20px; } .submit-btn, .copy-btn { background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; border: none; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer; margin: 10px; } .submit-btn:hover, .copy-btn:hover { background-color: #45a049; } .output-box { border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px; height: 300px; overflow-y: auto; } """

Then, pass this CSS to the Blocks:

def create_ui(): with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(), css=css) as demo: # ... rest of the UI code ...

This would style the header, buttons, and output box to look more modern and iOS-like with rounded corners, padding, and hover effects.

Testing all these changes, the app should now allow multiple file uploads, process them, display the extracted text in a styled textbox, and allow copying the text with a button. The files are saved automatically with the "_extracted.txt" suffix.
