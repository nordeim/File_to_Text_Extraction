You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

*Your task* is to enhance the attached file conversion app with additional features like multiple file selection, file browsing, a preview box with copy functionality, and iOS-like styling. You will use the following guide to approach this task systematically, considering all requirements and planning the implementation before writing the code. You can use the attached image as inspiration to design your UI.

First, carefully analyze the requirements:
1. Add ability to browse for input file(s)
   - Need to modify the file input component to allow browsing
   - Gradio's File component already supports this, but we'll enhance it
2. Allow multiple file selection before extraction
   - Need to modify file_input to accept multiple files
   - Update process_file to handle multiple files
   - Need to manage multiple outputs and status messages
3. Add text preview box with copy button
   - Need a new component for preview
   - Add copy functionality (Gradio has built-in support for this)
   - Need to format the preview to show multiple files' content
4. Make the app iOS-like, attractive, and user-friendly
   - Use Gradio's theming capabilities
   - Implement clean, minimal design
   - Add proper spacing and layout
   - Use appropriate colors and fonts
   - Add loading states and progress feedback
Now, let's plan the implementation:
1. Import Updates:
   - Need to import additional Gradio components for styling
   - Import time for progress simulation if needed
   - Import json for potential copy functionality
2. File Processing Updates:
   - Modify process_file to handle list of files
   - Create helper function to process individual files
   - Update status messages to handle multiple files
   - Create formatted preview output for multiple files
3. Interface Updates:
   - Use Gradio Blocks for better layout control
   - Implement custom CSS for iOS-like styling
   - Add multiple file input with file_count="multiple"
   - Add preview box with copy button
   - Implement loading states
   - Add clear button for file selection
   - Add progress indicators
4. Styling:
   - Use soft colors (light grays, whites)
   - Implement shadow effects
   - Use rounded corners
   - Clean typography
   - Proper spacing and padding
5. User Experience:
   - Add tooltips for buttons
   - Implement error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add success indicators
   - Make layout responsive
Let's plan the new interface structure:
- Header section with title and description
- Main content area:
  * File input section (multiple files, clear button)
  * Action buttons (Extract, Clear)
  * Status display
  * Preview section with copy button
- Footer with additional info
Now, let's implement these changes, keeping the existing functionality while adding the new features.
First, let's validate the approach:
- Gradio supports multiple file uploads natively
- Gradio's Textbox supports copy functionality
- Gradio Blocks allows for custom layouts
- The existing extraction functions can be reused with minor modifications
- CSS can be injected for iOS-like styling
This approach should work well. Let's implement it, making sure to:
- Keep existing functionality intact
- Add clear error handling
- Implement proper state management
- Ensure responsive design
- Add user feedback mechanisms
Now proceed with the implementation, updating the necessary sections.
